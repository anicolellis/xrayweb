# xrayweb
Web interface for X-ray properties of the elements, using Python and Flask


This library provides a web interface to X-ray properties of the elements, including

- physical properties
- absorption edge energies
- emission edge energies

- attenuation coefficients


In addition, this includes a form to calculate X-ray attenuation and
scattering factors for materials and compounds given the chemical formula
and density.


## status

This is at the  "proof of concept" stage.

Running the script "run.py" with

      > python run.py

will launch a local web server with the app running at
http://127.0.0.1:4966/
